      At Bahas, we take the privacy of our users very seriously. This Privacy
      Policy outlines the type of information we collect, how we use that
      information, and how we protect our users' data.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
    <p>
      We do not collect any personal information except gmail addresses from our
      users. We do not require users to provide their real names, email
      addresses, phone numbers, or any other identifiable information. We do,
      however, collect non-personal information such as IP addresses, device
      information, and usage data to help us improve our application.
    </p>

    <p><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></p>

    <p>
      The non-personal information we collect is used to help us improve our
      application, such as identifying areas of the application that need
      improvement or analysing user behaviour to make the application more
      user-friendly. We may also use this information to generate statistical
      reports about our user base.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Data Security</strong></p>

    <p>
      We use industry-standard encryption and security measures to protect our
      users' data. We also regularly review and update our security practices to
      ensure that our users' data is protected from unauthorised access or
      disclosure.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Sharing of Information</strong></p>

    <p>
      We do not share any personal information with third-party companies or
      organisations. We may, however, share non-personal information such as
      usage data with third-party analytics providers to help us improve our
      application.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

    <p>
      We use cookies to improve the user experience of our application. Cookies
      are small files that are stored on a user's device to help the application
      remember user preferences and settings. Users can choose to disable
      cookies in their browser settings.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Changes to Privacy Policy</strong></p>

    <p>
      We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time.
      Users will be notified of any changes to the Privacy Policy through the
      application.
    </p>
